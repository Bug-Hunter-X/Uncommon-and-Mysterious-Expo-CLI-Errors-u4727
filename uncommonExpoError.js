This error occurs when using Expo CLI and you encounter an unexpected behavior or a crash without a clear error message from the CLI itself. This often happens due to underlying issues within the project's configuration files (like `app.json`, `package.json`, or `eas.json`), dependencies, or even system-level problems like incorrect environment variables or conflicting tools.
