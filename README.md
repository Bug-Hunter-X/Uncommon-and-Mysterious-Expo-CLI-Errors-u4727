# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors

This repository demonstrates a scenario where debugging Expo CLI issues becomes challenging due to a lack of explicit error messages. The problem involves unexpected behavior or crashes without clear indications from the Expo CLI itself.  This often stems from subtle problems in project configuration, dependencies, or system-level inconsistencies.

## Problem Description

The project might build successfully but exhibit unexpected behavior during runtime (e.g., crashes, incorrect functionality).  Standard debugging techniques may yield limited results due to the absence of clear error messages from the Expo CLI.  This is particularly frustrating when the error is sporadic or environment-specific.

## Solution

The solution focuses on a systematic approach to identify the root cause.  This may involve reviewing logs carefully, ensuring proper project configurations, verifying dependencies, and systematically eliminating potential conflicts or issues one-by-one.  The solution provided demonstrates a potential way to uncover such an issue by simulating it in a controlled scenario.

## Reproducing the Error (Simulated)

The `uncommonExpoError.js` file simulates an uncommon error by triggering an unhandled promise rejection without clear error messages displayed in Expo CLI.  It is a simplification to illustrate the type of problem.
