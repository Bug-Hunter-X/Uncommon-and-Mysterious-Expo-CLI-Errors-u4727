The solution focuses on systematic debugging to find the root cause of the error.  Here's a more detailed approach:

1. **Check the Expo CLI logs**:  Examine the console output of the Expo CLI command extremely carefully. Often, hidden within seemingly innocuous messages or warnings, you might find a clue.
2. **Verify project configuration files**: Double-check `app.json`, `package.json`, and `eas.json` for any typos, inconsistencies, or unexpected values. Ensure that the paths, names, and versions of your dependencies are correct.
3. **Examine dependency versions**: Update your dependencies to the latest versions or try reverting to earlier versions to pinpoint if a specific dependency is the cause.
4. **Check for conflicting tools or configurations**: Ensure that no other tools or system-level settings are interfering with Expo CLI.  Try creating a fresh project to determine if the issue is with the project itself or the environment.
5. **Isolate the problem**: Comment out sections of your code, rebuild, and test to locate the source of the unexpected behavior. Use a debugger if possible to trace the flow of your application.
6. **Environment variables**: Check if environment variables are correctly set up and not causing conflicts.
7. **Simulate with a simple project**: If possible, replicate the issue with a simplified Expo project. This helps isolate if the error is project-specific or related to the Expo CLI itself.
